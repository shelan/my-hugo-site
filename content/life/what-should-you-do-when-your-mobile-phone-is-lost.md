I have lost twice and yes it is not a great position to be. But these two incidents had two different implications. When i lost my first phone it was a nokia phone (N71 to be exact) which was quite a smart phone at that time around 2007. Yes i wanted to find the phone but could not the story was over and life went on. But... &nbsp;Second time i lost a Nexus 4 which is android.<br /><br />So what is the big deal?<br /><br />"Oh my gmail account"<br /><br />When i sensed for the first time that i have lost my mobile phone the first thing that came to my mind was "oh gosh all my accounts are there". But fortunately i have thought about this topic before i lost this phone so the next steps to be done was obvious to me. I think you might be interesting and you may have better suggestions as well. :)<br /><br />Three important things<br /><br />1) Android phone has your email account , If you use gmail as the primary account then you might use gmail for most of other online accounts as well. (Facebook , twitter, ebay so on...)<br /><br />So if anyone can get hold of it then you are doomed, Because anyone can use forgot my username or password reset features to take control of other account.<br /><br />2) Android phone has all your data :). In this what google does not back up. I think only your life which cannot be backed up restore later.<br /><br />3) If your phone is not pin protected or not protected with any other mechanism then you are at the highest level of vulnerability.<br /><br /><b>So what I should do?</b><br /><br />1) Change your email address password immediately. This is very crucial and the most important step<br /><br />You can check login history here. If there is a recent login just after you<br /><a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity?pli=1">https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity?pli=1</a><br /><br />2) You should visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager">https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager</a>. Using this you can erase your mobile phone data (or in other words do a remote wipe out of data).<br /><br />This will only happen if the device is online.<br /><br />If you need to locate the device you need to do it before the wipe out using the same above link.<br /><br />3) You may register a police complaint at last.<br /><br />Finding the phone is more important. But for someone who needs to protect data, other accounts and also privacy above mentioned steps becomes vital.<br /><br />If you have other suggestions please do share in comments :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
