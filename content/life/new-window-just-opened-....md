<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; It has been a week since i have became a student once more in my life. I like the experience of recreating the feelings that i had when i was a student ago two years back. Since now this blog is full of technical content and i did not have much time to blog much about my other experiences. But now this is a new life so thought of doing the same to my blog. Lets see how the new story unfolds...<br /><br />I am an <a href="http://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/joint/emdc" target="_blank">EMDC</a> ( European Masters in Distributed Computing) student at IST (Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico) and KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) in Sweden. This offering is great not only because of the content it offers but the cultural experience you will gain. It is a bonus..<br /><br />During the first week I was fortunate to visit some of the very beautiful places in Lisbon. I should say the coastal area is really fantastic even though i am coming from a place with full of beaches covering my beautiful island Sri Lanka. I will post more about that place in another post with more details.. and of course with pictures. Till then Just relax with the view out of my apartment...<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/10662141_10152378216449537_7174922840836620794_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="379" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/10662141_10152378216449537_7174922840836620794_o.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div>
