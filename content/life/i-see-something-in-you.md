Steve Jobs once said that you cannot connect dots by looking backwards. That saying stays and will stay in my heart forever, remembering
the impact of tiny little incidents and opportunities in my life. You will never know, the smallest opportunity that blinks
before you might become in the future.

I have watched the following video " I see something in you" by Dhananjaya Hettiarachchi, who won the Intentional competition for
 public speaking. It reminds me of my potential to be someone more than I am. If you listen, may be.. may be.. you will realize
 that too. :)
