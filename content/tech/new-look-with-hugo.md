Why suddenly?

Because i wanted freedom. :)

I moved from blogger to [hugo](http://gohugo.io) which is a static site generator written in golang. It is super fast and looks geeky enough for someone who loves to mess with the stuf and also will be easy enough to handle.

There are lots of things i considered before moving into Hugo.

 - I need to own my content and now i have backups in Github as well as in my laptop
 - I want my layout. So i designed my own theme with flat-ui/bootstrap. (I will publish it as a theme soon.)
 - I want a static site but powerful enough to blog.
 - I need to write content using Markdown
 - Finally something super fast to speed up the process.

If you want to move from blogger following script would be really helpful.
