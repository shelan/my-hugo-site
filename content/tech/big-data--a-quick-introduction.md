Enterprises are awash with data, easily amassing terabytes and even petabytes of information.</div><div><br /><b>Velocity</b> – Often time-sensitive, big data must be used as it is streaming in to the enterprise in order to maximize its value to the business.</div><div><br /><b>Variety</b> – Big data extends beyond structured data, including unstructured data of all varieties: text, audio, video, click streams, log files and more."</div><div>[1]</div><div><br /></div><div>The most interesting challenge as well as the opportunity comes for companies who deals with Big data.
